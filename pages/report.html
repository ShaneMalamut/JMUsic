                <li>You are viewing the site right now. Hopefully that means it's published!</li>
                <li>This is report.html and it is accessible from the main page on the navigation bar</li>
                <li>The site has a main page and four album pages. All pages are accessible from the navigation bar, or from the main page.</li>
                <li>The header has the title of the project "JMUsic!" and a short tagline</li>
                <li>The site has a nav bar that is fixed to the top of the screen</li>
                <li>The site reformats flex containers to be stacked vertically on small screens. The site also reformats the navigation bar to be less intrusive on smaller screens</li>
                <li>The site includes album covers with alt text denoting that it is an album cover for a specific album</li>
                <li>All validation was successful before submission</li>
                <li>The nav bar and heading elements use the sans-serif font Calibri, while the paragraph texts use the serif font Times New Roman</li>
                <li>The site includes a form on the main page for adding new albums, and a form on each album page for adding remixes/mashups</li>
                <li>The site includes links to the YouTube playlists and videos for each album/song</li>
                <li>Some ideas:
                    <ol>
                        <li>automatic updating of data such as view counts using YouTube API</li>
                        <li>ability to upload albums/remixes from other platforms such as Soundcloud or Bandcamp, and they will still appear seemlessly on the page</li>
                        <li>Embedded media players for songs</li>
                    </ol>
